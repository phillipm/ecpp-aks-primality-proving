Compile instructions:
Type the following in a CADE lab terminal window to compile the program.
cd program
make
OR
cd program
g++ aks.cpp ecpp.cpp miller-rabin.cpp -o run -lgmp -lmpfr
g++ aks.cpp aks-driver.cpp -o aks -lgmp -lmpfr
g++ miller-rabin.cpp miller-rabin.cpp -o miller-rabin -lgmp -lmpfr
g++ miller-rabin.cpp gprime.cpp -o gprime -lgmp -lmpfr


Run instructions:
There are several programs provided.  The primary one is compiled as "run". For
program usage information type the following in a CADE lab terminal window:
./program/run -?

You can also run our AKS and Miller-Rabin implementations separately as shown:
./program/aks
./program/miller-rabin

The Miller-Rabin outputs a 0 for composite numbers, a 1 for probably prime
numbers and a 2 for proven prime numbers.

There is also the "gprime" program that can generate prime numbers of arbitrary
size that uses the Miller-Rabbin implementation.

The "run" program is capable of printing certificates as shown:
./program/run -c < file-with-one-number-per-line

The "run" program has a self-test mode that just does every prime number:
./program/run -t

The "run" program can be started in an interactive mode, but you must press
control-d to exit the program when in interactive mode.
./program/run

For additional information, see the usage page for the "run" program or the
Background information below.


Background:
The "run" program is a combination of multiple algorithms: AKS, ECPP, and 
Miller-Rabin. The primary programs are Miller-Rabin and ECPP with a fallback
option to AKS. The program has multiple modes of operation as mentioned above.
If the ECPP algorithm fails to find the number prime it will run the AKS
algorithm to finish the job. Running times for decimal digit numbers of 170 or
less typically take under 10 minutes with a few exceptions. The program should
be able to compute numbers of any size reasonably quickly. Smaller numbers tend
to run the AKS algorithm more frequently than larger numbers.
